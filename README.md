In this project, I simulated part of the signal-processing chain used in modern hearing aids. The 
goal was to model how hearing aids adjust the sound entering the ear canal using frequency
dependent amplification. I implemented the M-selection model, which separates the ear canal 
into segments and applies different acoustic gains based on distance from the eardrum. 
Using the given transfer function 
I analyzed how the system behaves for different values of the parameters μ, α, and β. The work 
included deriving the function for μ=1, plotting the frequency response, and examining how the 
poles and zeros influence stability. 
After defining the full filter 
I plotted its pole–zero diagram and evaluated the system’s stability and gain characteristics. The 
simulation results helped illustrate how hearing-aid filters shape incoming sound and how 
parameter choices affect clarity, loudness, and overall performance.
